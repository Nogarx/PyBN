    "PyBN is constructed with the idea of ease of use, thus it is built from several compatible modules. The central one is the network module which defines some of the most popular flavor of boolean networks. Let's start by running a simple Boolean Network. The first ingridient we require is a graph. Since Boolean Networks are intrinsecally related to graphs we decided to separate the core structure from the Boolean network from its functionally. The graph must be presented as a list of adjacencies."
